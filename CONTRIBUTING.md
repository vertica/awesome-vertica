# Contribution Guidelines

This is an attempt to make a curated list of high-quality, maintained, useful [Vertica](https://www.vertica.com/) related packages/projects/libraries/resources. Each item in the list must either be free and open source, or have a note which explicitly states that the software is commercial.

This list accepts and encourages pull requests.

- You may add, remove, or change:
  - Categories
  - Items
- **To add, remove, or change things on the list:** Submit a pull request to [README.md](README.md), add comment explaining the reasoning behind the change. One pull request for one item.

### Pull request guidelines

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Suggested project/package should be tested and documented.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[item](link) - Short description.`
- Each item should be limited to one link.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a period.
- Don't mention `vertica` in the description as it's implied.
- Remove trailing whitespace.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- List items should be sorted alphabetically.
- Add a category if needed. Add the category title to [Contents](README.md#contents).
