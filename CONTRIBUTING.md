# Contribution Guidelines

This is an attempt to make a curated list of high-quality, maintained, useful [Vertica](https://www.vertica.com/) related packages/projects/libraries/resources. Each item in the list must either be free and open source, or have a note which explicitly states that the software is commercial. Commercial software should have some kind of free or community version so that users may experience it without purchasing anything.

This list accepts and encourages pull requests.

- You may add, remove, or change:
  - Categories
  - Items
- **To add, remove, or change things on the list:** Submit a pull request to [README.md](README.md), add comment explaining the reasoning behind the change. One pull request for one item.

### Pull request guidelines

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Suggested project/package should be tested and documented.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[item](link) - Short description.`
- Each item should be limited to one link.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a period.
- Don't mention `vertica` in the description as it's implied.
- Remove trailing whitespace.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- List items should be sorted alphabetically.
- Add a category if needed. Add the category title to [Contents](README.md#contents).
